# Functions & Modules in Python

This repository contains two Python programs that demonstrate the use of functions and the built-in `math` module in Python.

## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
**File:** `task1_factorial.py`

### Problem Statement:
- Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument.
- Calculates its factorial using either a loop or recursion.
- Returns the calculated factorial.
- Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

### Expected Output:
```

Enter a number: 5
Factorial of 5 is:
120

```

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
**File:** `task2_math_module.py`

### Problem Statement:
- Asks the user for a number as input.
- Uses the `math` module to calculate:
  - Square root of the number
  - Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
  - Sine of the number (in radians)
- Displays the results.

### Expected Output:
If the user enters **25**:
```

Enter a number: 25
Square root: 5.0
Logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
Sine: -0.13235175009777303
